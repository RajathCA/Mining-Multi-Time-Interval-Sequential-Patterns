# Mining-Multi-Time-Interval-Sequential-Patterns
This project is an implementation based on the paper titled 'On mining multi-time-interval sequential patterns'. Few optimizations have been made in our implementation that improve runtime and memory utilization when compared to the original implementations described by the authors.
