# Mining-Multi-Time-Interval-Sequential-Patterns
A python implementation based on the paper titled 'On mining multi-time-interval sequential patterns'. The MI-Apriori Algorithm and the MI-PrefixSpan Algorithm described in the paper were tweaked to implement more efficient versions of the algorithms.
